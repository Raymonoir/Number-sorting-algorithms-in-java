# Number-sorting-algorithms-in-java
<h1> Background </h1>
For my Further Mathematics A-Level i was required to be able to complete Bubble, Merge and Shuttle sort by hand as part of my exam. As doing this by hand on a list of numbers is a tedious task, i wanted to create a program that could do it easily. I also included Insertion sort as i wished to learn a new sorting algorithm.
<br>
The algorithms implemented: <br>
-Bubble sort <br>
-Merge sort <br>
-Shuttle sort <br>
-Insertion sort <br>


<h1> Instructions</h1>
The class 'Sorting' contains a variable 'arr' in which the numbers you wish to sort need to be stored, within that class each sorting algorithm class has been instantiated with that array as a parameter. You just need to call the sort method for the sorting algorithn you wish to use.

<h1> Possible additions</h1>
1. Add GUI <br>
2. Add more sorting algorithms<br>
3. Make use of generics and alter classes to allow any object with a compareTo method to be correctly sorted.
